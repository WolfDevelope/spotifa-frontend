    "song-1": `I just pretend that I'm in the dark and  
  I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss  
  I'd rather be so oblivious  
  I'd rather be with you  
    
  When it's said, when it's done, yeah  
  I would never let you know  
  I'm ashamed of what I've done, yeah  
  When I look at you...`,
  
    "song-2": `This is the end  
  Hold your breath and count to ten  
  Feel the earth move and then  
  Hear my heart burst again  
    
  Let the sky fall  
  When it crumbles  
  We will stand tall  
  Face it all together...`,
  
    "song-3": `You're in the corner of my mind again  
  I see your name, it's like a sign again  
  You said you're not afraid to lose me  
  That sounds so true, yeah, that's so true...`,
  
    "song-4": `Azizam  
  I wrote your name into the stars  
  And every night I wonder where you are  
  You light the sky when it gets dark  
  Azizam, you have my heart...`,
  
    "song-5": `Take me back to LA  
  Where the sun always shines and the skies never gray  
  I’m lost in this city but I wanna escape  
  Back to the lights of LA...`,
  
    "song-6": `High fashion, that’s what you bring  
  Golden hour, you’re my everything  
  Even when the night falls, you’re the bling  
  Yeah, you're high fashion in my dreams...`,
  
    "song-7": `You and I, we’re birds of a feather  
  Flying high, through stormy weather  
  Hold me close, and don’t let go  
  You're all I need to know...`,
  
    "song-8": `Illusion  
  What are you hiding behind those eyes?  
  You talk like love, but it's just disguise  
  Illusion, sweet confusion  
  I'm drowning in your lies...`,
  
    "song-9": `If I'm gonna die, I’ll die with a smile  
  Live like a fire, burning wild  
  Dance like it’s the end of time  
  With your love, I feel alive...`,
  
    "song-10": `I'm working late 'cause I'm a singer  
  But you make it hot like an espresso  
  Wanna sip you slow  
  'Cause you taste so bold...`,
